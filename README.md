# RecipeListApp

This is a simple multi-screen app that allows you to select the name and picture of a meal in a list, and navigate
to the details page. This page lists a large image of the dish, followed by the ingredients and directions on preparing it.

The following skills were used in this app:
* MVVM design pattern
* Decoding/parsing JSON
* Multi-view app via NavigationView/NavigationLink
* Observable changes in the data (if/when the JSON updates)
* etc.
